DIY screenprining how-to's, references, and advice of varying detail.

--------

 - [Screenprinting at Home](http://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/how-to-screen-printsilkscreening-at-home/)

this tutorial goes through making your own screen, which i don't necessarily recommend (i used to do this, and the results were decent, but not as good as a professional screen would produce), but also has some valuable information about exposure practices. 

 - [Adventures in DIY Screenprinting](http://diysilkscreenprinting.blogspot.com/)

 this site has a wealth of information about the topic, and lots of valuable troubleshooting pointers. 

 - [A Simple Guide to Printing Your Own Shirts](http://lifehacker.com/5886483/simple-guide-to-screen-printing-your-own-shirts)

 i love lifehacker, and this article and accompanying video do a great job of demonstrating how easy it is to print at home with a lot of household materials.
