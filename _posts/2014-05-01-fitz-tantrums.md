i was thrilled to be asked to design & print a poster for a Lollapalooza aftershow with Fitz & the Tantrums. i wanted to make something bright & vibrant, but with a little of that grit that i love so much. i hand-drew every layer and let the imperfections keep it interesting. 

printed on French Speckletone Madero Beach, 19x15, edition of 100-ish. coordinated by the wonderful Dan Polyak.

(side note: i have a few extras left around, email me if you're interested.)
