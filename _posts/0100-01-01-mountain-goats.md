[the mountain goats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRP6egIEABk) are without a doubt one of my favorite active bands. when i heard they were rolling through town, i thought it’d be fun to mock up a poster for their show and see if they’d let me print it for them. i actually heard back from their publicist, which was really cool, but unfortunately they already had an artist working with them for the tour. i still had fun making this, though.
