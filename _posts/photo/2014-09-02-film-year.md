eight rolls of film. that's what it took me, an amateur photographer, to document eight months of my life. i'm growing to enjoy analog photography more & more with each exposure, and if i can say so, i believe i'm improving. that's always a nice feeling.

i try to travel as much as i can, so these photos were taken mostly in DC, Utah, North Carolina, and Chicago, with a few in various other states of transition. some hold moments of significant gravity, that i have to say would not carry as much weight were they shot digitally. others are just keepsakes from my uncalculated ambling. something of a byproduct of having a camera slung over your shoulder while you try to figure out what it is you want from life.

anyway, i'll try not to ramble too much.

_near the end of my artist residency in Green River, i went for a walk to the edge of town while the sun was setting. i came across this bird who had gotten it's foot caught in the bunched strands of a telephone wire. it thrashed & struggled, losing feathers and panting, to no avail. it was pitiful in every sense of the word, though there wasn't much i could do to help. i kept walking, trying not to think about it. on my way home, roughly 15 minutes later, i passed the bird again. just as i walked under the wire to take another look, the bird freed itself and flew away in the fading light._
