the last half of my 2015, in film.

when my grandfather passed away in 2012, he left boxes of slides, photos, and film negatives behind. now, i'm no luddite, but of the thousands upon thousands of photos i've taken on my phone, i can confidently assume none will ever be viewed by any offspring of mine. hell, they probably won't even be looked at by me again.

at the risk of sounding melodramatic, the ease of capturing a moment and remembering it effortlessly in our pockets has stripped the weight from the experience. shooting film makes me question if the moment is worth saving. if the answer is no, it reminds me that it's alright to remember things imperfectly, and to settle for an uninterrupted experience with no physical evidence.

<!--my shutter went quiet there for a moment, but judging by the stacks of photos under my bed, when i had my camera with me, i wasn't shy about using it. i'm still shooting mostly film, and i'm still getting the hang of it, but my batting average is certainly improving. never one to sit still for too long, these photos were taken in Georgia, Kansas, Chicago, Ohio, Maryland, Michigan, and many other places in between. -->

2015, particularly it's end, was a rough one. that said, i can't remember the last time i've felt quite as optimistic about a new year.
