personal screenprint. it was my first time drawing directly onto acetate, and i gotta say, i didn't hate it. after laboring over every line, there's a much more personal connection with the print, and it gives you nice imperfections that you just can't fake with a computer. that being said, i'm not abandonding the printed transparency anytime soon.
