the good folks at Imgur were planning a summer meetup to bring their famous community together IRL. naturally they called it Camp Imgur, and thankfully they recruited me to make them some goodies for it. i was fortunate enough to do the logo, shirts, tote bags, programs, signage - pretty much the whole shabang. 

it should come as no suprise that the team there is fun as hell to work with.
