		<p>a brief disclaimer:</p>

		<p>as with many designers, i've had an interest in type for a while, but all i've learned of the subject is from books, the internet, and my own curious tinkering. this is my first attempt at creating a font, so it's far from perfect. i'm releasing it open-source because it was - and is - an experiment. if you see an issue, <a href='https://github.com/ryantroyford/central-union-mission/issues'>let me know</a>, or take a stab at fixing it yourself by <a href='https://github.com/ryantroyford/central-union-mission'>forking the project on github</a>. constructive criticism is always welcome.</p>

		<p>otherwise, i hope you enjoy it. if you happen to use it in a project, <a href='mailto:ryantroyford@gmail.com'>drop me a line</a>. i'd love to see it out in the wild.</p>

		<p>feel like donating? instead of throwing a few bucks at my shitty font, why not help those who really need it at the <a href="https://www.missiondc.org/donate/">Central Union Mission</a>.</p>
